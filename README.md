# Instabot

Free Instagram python bot, [private Instagram API emulator](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/instabot/api) and a [huge amount of ready-to-use example scripts](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/tree/master/examples).

We are the most used Instagram library on GitHub (according to "Used by" counter). üéâ Join our [Large Telegram community](https://t.me/instabotproject) for more Instagram tricks. üöÄ

## Important

Right now the usage of this library (as probably others too) may harm your Instagram's profile because of new script-detection algorithms. You were warned (although to be honest I've been using it for years and have never had an issue, algorithms must not be that good üòâ).

Instabot has a lot of predefined filters (like skipping very popular accounts because they will not notice you) which maximizes the overall impact. But you can remove them if you like or even set your parameters: (full list [here](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot/blob/master/instabot/bot/bot.py#L86))

As you may know, Instagram closed its API in summer 2016\. This Python module can do the same things without any effort.

## What is it?

Instabot is a module for the Python language, which not only implements the wrapper over the Instagram API, but also various useful functions, such as ‚Äúsubscribe to the list of people‚Äù, ‚Äúlike photos by hashtags‚Äù, ‚Äúunsubscribe from non-followers‚Äù and so on. Instabot is smart enough: [read](/docs/en/Filtration.html), for example, how it filters people on which it is going to subscribe.
